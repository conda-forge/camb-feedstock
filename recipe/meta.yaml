  summary: Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background
  description: |
    Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background
    by Antony Lewis and Anthony Challinor

    Features:
      - Support for closed, open and flat models
      - Scalar, vector and tensor modes including polarization
      - Output Cl, matter transfer functions, matter power spectrum and Ïƒ8
      - Fast computation to ~0.3-0.1% accuracy, with controllable accuracy level
      - Relatively structured and easily extendable Fortran 90 code
      - Efficient support for massive neutrinos
      - Absolute computations from correctly normalized initial power spectra
      - Computation of lensed CMB power spectra and lensing potential power spectrum
      - Internally parallelized for fast execution on multi-processor machines
      - Use CAMB with CosmoMC for Monte-Carlo parameter estimation
      - Constant equation of state quintessence (or variable PPF)
      - Support for general correlated adiabatic/isocurvature initial conditions
      - Accurate full-sky calculation of lensed power spectra (astro-ph/0502425)
      - Integrated interface to HALOFIT for non-linear fitting
      - support for arbitrary neutrino mass splittings
      - For 21cm, lensing and number count power spectra see this extension
      - For perturbed recombination and effect on small-scale baryons see this extension
      - Calculation of local primordial and CMB lensing bispectra
      - Easy-to-use Python wrapper
